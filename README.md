# Classification data analysis web app

The web application was created using the `streamlit` package and allows you to perform data analysis along with the creation of predictive classification models using machine learning methods such as:
- Principal Component Analysis
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

In addition, a score report is generated with all the sheets in .xlsx format so you can easily download your results!
