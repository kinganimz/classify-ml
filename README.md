### Your go-to app for seamless data analysis and powerful ML classification, all in one place!

The web application was developed using the `streamlit` package and allows to perform data analysis along with the creation of predictive classification models using machine learning methods, such as:
- **K Nearest Neighbors**
- **Support Vector Machine**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Neural Network**

Importantly, the application also includes two tabs responsible for the preliminary analysis of your imported data with its exploration using the **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** method.

In addition, a score report is generated with all the sheets in .xlsx format so you can easily **download your results**!
