# Classification data analysis web app

The web application was developed using the `streamlit` package and allows to perform data analysis along with the creation of predictive classification models using machine learning methods, such as:
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Importantly, the application also includes two tabs responsible for the preliminary analysis of your imported data with its exploration using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method.
In addition, a score report is generated with all the sheets in .xlsx format so you can easily download your results!
